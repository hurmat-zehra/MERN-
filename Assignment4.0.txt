Q3.Difference between framework and API?
Framework:
a.A pre-built, reusable structure guiding the development of an entire application.
b.Provides an architecture, design patterns, and often dictates the flow of control.
c.Developers extend the framework by fitting their code into the predefined structure.
d.Examples include Django and Ruby on Rails for web development.
API (Application Programming Interface):
a.A set of rules and tools allowing different software components to communicate.
b.Specifies methods and data formats for requesting and exchanging information.
c.Abstracts underlying implementation details, focusing on interaction.
d.Examples include the Twitter API for social media integration and Java API for building Java applications.
In summary, a framework shapes the entire application's development, while an API facilitates communication between different software components.
