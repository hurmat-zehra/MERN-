Q3. Difference between scalable and vector graphics?
Vector Graphics:
1. Representation: Vector graphics use mathematical equations to define shapes, lines, and colors.
2. Scalability: They are resolution-independent, allowing for unlimited scaling without loss of quality.
3. File Size: Vector files are typically smaller as they store mathematical instructions rather than pixel data.
4. Editing: Easy to edit, reshape, and modify individual elements without loss of quality.
Raster (Scalable) Graphics:
1. Representation: Raster graphics (or scaler graphics) are composed of a grid of pixels, each with a specific color value.
2. Scalability: They have a fixed resolution and may lose quality (pixelate) when scaled up.
3. File Size: Raster files can be larger as they store information for each pixel in the image.
4. Editing: Editing can be more challenging, especially when resizing or changing proportions, as it may result in a loss of quality.
Q4. What is WHATWG?
WHATWG, or the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, is a community-driven organization that focuses on the development and evolution of web standards and technologies. Formed in 2004 by individuals from companies like Apple, Mozilla, and Opera, WHATWG aims to advance web technologies by creating living standards for HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and various Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). 
Q5. What is SVG?
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an XML-based vector image format for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. Unlike raster graphics, which use pixels to represent images, SVG uses mathematical descriptions to define shapes and graphics, making it resolution-independent. 
Q6. VML vs SVG?
VML (Vector Markup Language):
Origin: VML was developed by Microsoft and was primarily associated with Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.
Usage: It was used as a standard for displaying vector graphics on the web, especially in the early 2000s.
Compatibility: VML had limited cross-browser support and was mainly supported by Internet Explorer. As other browsers gained popularity and standards like SVG emerged, VML became less relevant.
Status: VML has been deprecated, and modern browsers do not support it. Its usage has been replaced by other technologies like SVG.
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):
Origin: SVG is an open standard that was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and first introduced in 1999.
Usage: SVG is widely used for creating vector graphics on the web. It is supported by most modern web browsers, making it a more versatile and widely adopted standard.
Compatibility: SVG is supported across different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. This broad support has contributed to SVG's popularity.
Features: SVG has a rich set of features, including support for animations, interactivity, and styling using CSS. It is well-suited for a wide range of applications, from simple graphics to complex data visualizations.
Q7.What is silverlight?
Silverlight was a deprecated web application framework developed by Microsoft. It was designed for creating rich internet applications and multimedia experiences for the web. Microsoft Silverlight provided features for building interactive user interfaces, streaming media, and animations.
Q7. What is semantic tag?
In the context of web development, particularly with regard to HTML and web content, "semantic" refers to the use of tags and elements that carry meaning about the structure of the document. For example, using <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <nav> tags in HTML5 provides semantic information about the sections of a webpage.
Q8. How web crawlers work?
Web crawlers, also known as spiders or bots, are automated programs designed to systematically browse the internet and collect information about web pages. Here's a short overview of how web crawlers work:
1. Starting Points:
Crawlers begin with a list of seed URLs, which act as the starting points for exploration.
2. Fetching Content:
The crawler sends HTTP requests to web servers to fetch the HTML content of web pages.
3. Parsing HTML:
The HTML content is parsed to extract information such as links, text, and metadata.
4. URL Extraction:
The crawler identifies and extracts hyperlinks (URLs) from the parsed HTML, adding them to a queue.
5. URL Frontier:
The queue, known as the URL frontier, is dynamically managed, prioritizing URLs based on factors like importance and relevance.
6. Crawling Algorithm:
Crawlers use algorithms to determine which URLs to visit next, considering factors like content quality, depth, and update frequency.
7.Recursion:
The process is recursive; for each URL, the crawler fetches the page, parses it, extracts new URLs, and adds them to the URL frontier.
8.Duplicate Handling:
Crawlers implement mechanisms to identify and handle duplicate URLs, avoiding unnecessary crawling of the same content.
9. Politeness and Throttling:
Crawlers follow politeness policies and rate limiting to avoid overloading web servers and ensure respectful behavior.
10. Indexing:
After crawling, some crawlers may index the collected data, creating a structured database for efficient retrieval.
11. Revisiting and Updating:
Crawlers periodically revisit pages to check for updates, maintaining the freshness of the search engine index.
Q9. How SEO happen?
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing websites to improve their visibility on search engines. Here's a short note on how SEO happens:
1. Keyword Research:
Identify relevant keywords that users might use when searching for content related to your website.
2. On-Page SEO:
Optimize individual web pages by incorporating target keywords in title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and content.
Ensure a clear URL structure and use proper HTML markup.
3. Content Quality:
Create high-quality, relevant, and original content that satisfies user intent and provides value.
4. User Experience:
Enhance the overall user experience with a mobile-friendly design, fast loading times, and easy navigation.
5. Technical SEO:
Address technical aspects like site speed, crawlability, and the use of sitemaps to make the site accessible to search engine crawlers.
6. Backlink Building:
Acquire high-quality backlinks from reputable websites to build your site's authority and credibility.
7. Social Media Engagement:
Engage with your audience on social media platforms, as social signals can impact search engine rankings.
8. Local SEO (if applicable):
For businesses targeting local markets, optimize for local search with accurate business information, local keywords, and Google My Business optimization.
9. Monitoring and Analytics:
Use tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to monitor website performance, track keyword rankings, and identify areas for improvement.
10. Adaptation to Algorithm Changes:
Stay informed about search engine algorithm updates and adapt your SEO strategies accordingly.
11. Continuous Optimization:
SEO is an ongoing process. Regularly update and optimize content, monitor performance, and refine strategies based on changing trends and user behavior.
